1st visualization: Sunburst --> Basic easily understandable
2nd visualization: Foamtree --> Encorporates everything and lends itself to interactions
Idea: show different visualizations based on the size of the dataset.
Optional visualization: Dendrogram --> only for small datasets < 150 elements & taxonomic nature
