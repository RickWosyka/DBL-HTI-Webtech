1st visualization: Sunburst --> Basic easily understandable
2nd visualization: Foamtree --> Encorporates everything and lends itself to interactions
2nd visualization if Foamtree fails: Generalized pythagoras tree --> looks pretty
Idea: show different visualizations based on the size of the dataset.
Optional visualization: Dendrogram --> only for small datasets < 150 elements & taxonomic nature

Possible tabs:
1) Numbers & magnitude
2) Labels
3) Look pretty
